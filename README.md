Project - MovieLens Data Analysis
The GroupLens Research Project is a research group in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota. The data is widely used for collaborative filtering and other filtering solutions. However, we will be using this data to act as a means to demonstrate our skill in using Python to “play” with data.

Objective:
To implement the techniques learnt as a part of the course.
Learning Outcomes:
Exploratory Data Analysis

Visualization using Python

Pandas – groupby, merging

Domain
Internet and Entertainment
Note that the project will need you to apply the concepts of groupby and merging extensively.
